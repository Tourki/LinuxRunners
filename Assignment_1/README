Assignment #1 (Femto shell):
Write a femto shell program in c language that echoes any command entered by the user. The shell will have only one built-in command "exit". If the user entered "exit", the shell will reply with "Good Bye" and terminate.

Here is an example of the output:
$ ./myFemtoShell
Ana Gahez ya Basha > Hello my shell
You said: Hello my shell
Ana Gahez ya Basha > what can you do?
You said: what can you do?
Ana Gahez ya Basha > You are super
You said: You are super
Ana Gahez ya Basha > exit
Good Bye :)
$

You can use any library routine (e.g. printf, strcmp, fgets, ..). The man pages will help you 😉 .

Important notes:
1- Please use a prompt message other than "Ana Gahez ya Basha" 😃 
2- Upload your code to github (يفضل جدا) or googledrive and send me a link through this form (https://forms.gle/RDimCrJRjMyjF9zH6).
3- Please include a README file with the compilation command(s) you used and example of the output.
4- The deadline for this assignment is Monday 19/9
